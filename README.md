*OUTPUT*:

**In this project, we built a spam detection system using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. We worked with the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, a real-world dataset containing over 5,500 labeled SMS messages (either ‘spam’ or ‘ham’). Using Python, we automated the download of the dataset from GitHub and loaded it with pandas.

For text preprocessing, we used TensorFlow Keras tools like Tokenizer to convert raw SMS messages into sequences of word indices, and pad_sequences to ensure all sequences had uniform length. We then built a simple neural network with an embedding layer, global average pooling, and dense layers, using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss to classify messages. The model was trained over ten epochs and evaluated using accuracy metrics, with visualizations of performance trends generated using Matplotlib.

We tested the model on new example messages to see how well it generalizes, predicting whether each was spam or ham with confidence scores. All code was written and executed in a Jupyter Notebook, an interactive Python environment perfect for data science and machine learning tasks, allowing for a mix of code, results, and explanations in one place.

This spam detection pipeline has clear real-world applications: it can be embedded in SMS systems, mobile apps, or email servers to automatically filter out unwanted messages. Beyond just spam, similar models can be applied to social media moderation, chatbot input filtering, and fraud detection in reviews or comments.

**Where It’s Applicable**

SMS apps — filters spam messages before they reach users.

Email systems — moves junk mail to the spam folder.

Social media — detects spam posts, fake links, or bot comments.

Chatbots — blocks spammy or abusive user inputs.

E-commerce — filters fake reviews or promotional spam.

Online forums — flags spam posts for moderators.

Banking & finance — stops phishing messages targeting customers.

Telecom networks — blocks mass SMS spam at the carrier level.**
